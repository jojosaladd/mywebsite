  sidebar_description: >
    I'm currently a master's student at Cornell University, advised by Dr. Fatma Baytar (Apparel Design), with Dr. Abe Davis (HCI) as my minor committee advisor. 
    My current research interests focus on the HCI applications of computer graphics and vision in the apparel industry. I bring a decade of industry experience 
    as a technical designer and fashion designer, which enriches my understanding of the practical challenges and solutions within the apparel industry. In my free time, I run a sewing blog at <a href="http://www.joannablumstudio.com">joannablumstudio.com</a>, enjoy reading classic literature 
    (Oscar Wilde is my favorite author!), playing tennis, baking, and spending time with my very cute furry cat, Uni, who just turned nine and even knows how to do tricks!
